# Interactive Power BI Dashboard for Hospital Operations

This repository presents a project focused on building a **dynamic Power BI dashboard** aimed at helping a multi-specialty hospital optimize its workflows, track appointments, and enhance patient experience through data-backed decisions.

---

## 🏥 Project Summary

As a **Healthcare Data Analyst**, I was assigned to develop a **Power BI dashboard** for a hospital’s administrative team. The goal was to uncover operational bottlenecks and enable real-time insights from patient and appointment datasets.

Key focus areas:
- Turning unrefined data into usable formats  
- Building insightful **DAX metrics**  
- Designing an intuitive, interactive report for leadership review  

---

## 🎯 Goals

To support the hospital in:

- Monitoring daily and monthly appointment loads  
- Evaluating patient engagement and retention  
- Enabling drill-downs by timeline, patient type, or department  
- Providing visual cues for trends and KPIs  

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation Workflow

Using **Power Query**, I executed the following tasks to ensure data readiness:

- 🚫 Removed redundant and duplicate records  
- 🔄 Handled missing fields with appropriate substitutions  
- 🧾 Reformatted columns for uniformity and clarity  

---

## 🧮 Insight Generation using DAX

With **DAX formulas**, I built custom calculations to drive key indicators:

- 📈 Growth in Appointments: Month-over-month patient booking trends  
- ✅ Appointment Completion Rate: Identifying no-shows and attended visits  
- 📊 Monthly Breakdown: Seasonal trends in hospital visits  
- 📌 Total Visits: Volume of appointments across the timeframe  
- 👥 Unique Patient Count: Footprint of the hospital’s reach  

---

## 📊 Visualization Strategy

Leveraging **Power BI’s advanced capabilities**, I structured a multi-layered dashboard:

- 📅 Time-based slicers and filters  
- 📉 Visual elements: Column charts, pie charts, KPI cards, and trend lines  
- 🔍 Dynamic filters to adjust views based on doctor, department, or time window  

The report enables stakeholders to navigate complex data effortlessly and discover operational patterns with minimal effort.

## 💡 Skills Applied & Enhanced

This project deepened my hands-on experience in:

- 🔧 Data cleansing and preprocessing in Power BI  
- 🧠 Constructing logic with DAX for custom metrics  
- 🎨 Data storytelling and user-first design  
- 🧭 Interactive and responsive dashboard layouts  

---

## ✅ Final Outcome

By converting raw hospital datasets into a sleek, filterable dashboard, I enabled faster and more informed decision-making for management. The project reflects my end-to-end capabilities in **data modeling, DAX logic creation, and crafting impactful visual analytics for healthcare use cases.**
